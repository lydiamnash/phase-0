/* REFLECTION QUESTIONS

What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?
It is important to know the location of the file and the file name.

What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?
We used floats, clears, and margins. Overall, it wasn't too difficult getting the site to look the way we wanted. I am curious about whether the methods we used are best practices though.

What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)
For the most part, we used color, font-size, font-variant, text-align, and borders.

Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you choose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?
Yes, we did this quite a bit actually. We also added a couple divs because we wanted to use the border attribute to make our lines. We also made two different divs for two columns. 

When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?
I think we had cleaner, better code. The original website uses html tables to layout their page which is not best practices. They also used inline styling.
