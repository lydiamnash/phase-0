			<h3>What are the benefits of version control?</h3>
			<p>So first off, what is version control. Version Control is a system that tracks updates or changes to files so that the user can go back to any specific version at a later time. If you play video games, it's like a check point or save point. When you die in the game or you make a mistake with something, you either go back to the check point or load up a save file and do something else to continue on with your game that way you want it. Version control is just that, a system that saves at points in time that allow you to load up whenever you feel the need to such as if you make a mistake or want to change something about a file or series of files. The benefit of it is that it saves time so that you don't have to basically start over.</p>

			<h3>How does git help you keep track of changes?</h3> 
			<p>Git is a great version control tool. The reason it's a great tool is because it keeps track of the changes you make for you. It's able to tell you what what file(s) have been changed, which ones haven't, and in the event that you like where you're at in your work, allows you to make a "commit" which is git's version of a save point. Easy way to think about it is "You're committing to the work you've done up to this point".</p>

			<h3>Why use GitHub to store your code?</h3> 
			<p>Github is a great place to store code because it allows others to see it, copy it, work on it, and give back suggestions they make. It allows for code to grow into something much bigger, much faster. It's like working on a school project in groups, except your group is more than a few classmates, it's every student in the world. It allows you to share what you have and others can share what they have or even learn from you.</p>

<!-- REFLECTION QUESTIONS	
What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
We used the article tag in this challenge. We also used the section tag, as well as the header tag. I often use the header tag and the section tag.


How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
Elements are ordered on the page according to the heirarchy in which they written in the html document. For example, the browser will look in an open tag and read all of the info inside that tag until it hits the closing tag. 


What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
I learned how to make a snippet! I never knew that you could do that in Sublime. I definintely think I'll be making more snippets in the future, particularly for CSS and Ruby files.
