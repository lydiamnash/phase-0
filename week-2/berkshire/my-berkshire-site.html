<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

It was fun translating the html into an actual web page! There weren't any issues.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

I'm still getting the hang of HTML5 vs. html so this was a bit confusing, but stackoverflow was a good resource.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

I think we did OK. We made sure to keep out all formatting.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

Good: It seems like with very little html knowledge, you can make an a well-structured site, which is cool.
Bad: it seems like there may be some obsolete tags. 

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

I don't have any tricks per se -- I just keep google handy so that if I forget something or need clarification, I can look it up.
