# Release 1: Questions

## What does puts do?
puts means "put string." Puts prints the output of a program in the console on a new line. It does not return anything.

## What is an integer? What is a float?
An integer is a number without a decimal point. A float is a number with a decimal point. 

## What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
When you do division with integers, you'll get integer values (these values are always rounded down). When you do division with floats, you'll get floats as answers. If I was explaining this to someone who didn't know anything about programming, I would say that these two types of number essentially dictate whether or not your answer is a rounded number or an exact number with a decimal point. In programming, though, integers are used much more often than floats because we generally consume things in whole numbers (for example, we don't read 1.8 e-mails).


# Release 2: Mini-challenge (numbers)

Number of hours in a year
````
puts 365 * 24
````

Number of minutes in a decade 
````
puts (365 * 10 + 2) * 24 * 60
````

# Release 7: Reflection Questions

## How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?
Ruby handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers like a calculator does; and it follows the standard order of operations. 

## What is the difference between integers and floats?
Integers are whole numbers with no decimal points, whereas floats are numbers wiht decimal points.

## What is the difference between integer and float division?
Integer division returns an integer. Float division returns a float (or a number with a decimal point).

## What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
Strings are groups of letters, punctuation marks, and/or digits that are bound together as a variable.

## What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
Local variables are variables that begin with a lowercase letter or underscore and have a defined scope in your program. It is also uninitialized. 

## How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
I thought this challenge was good - it was a good refresher of Ruby basics.
