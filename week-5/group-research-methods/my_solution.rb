# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
#I used the delete_if method which uses a condition to delete an element in an array or hash. I also downcased everything so it wouldn't treat upper/lowercase differently.

# Release 1: Identify and describe the Ruby method you implemented. Teach your
# accountability group how to use the methods.

# Release 3: Reflect!
# What did you learn about researching and explaining your research to others?
