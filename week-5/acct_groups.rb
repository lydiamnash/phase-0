# ACCOUNTABILITY GROUPS

# 1. PSEUDOCODE
# INPUT: List of names (array)
# OUTPUT: Groups with names, ideally 4-5, no less than 3

# COUNT the number of people in the cohort
# DIVIDE by 5, check remainder
# IF remainder is 1-2
	# DIVIDE the count by 4
	# IF remainder is 1-2
# ELSE (if remainder is equal to 0, 3, or 4, it's OK)



# 2. INITIAL SOLUTION

# 4. REFACTOR


# 5. DRIVER CODE


# 6. REFLECT

What was the most interesting and most difficult part of this challenge?

Do you feel you are improving in your ability to write pseudocode and break the problem down?

Was your approach for automating this task a good solution? What could have made it even better?

What data structure did you decide to store the accountability groups in and why?

What did you learn in the process of refactoring your initial solution? Did you learn any new Ruby methods?
